People born into the number 1 often become great leaders and for this
reason, they make great entrepreneurs, freelancers, generals,
commanders, CEOs and producers. Any path with takes them out ahead of
the general populous and onto the front lines of life will give them
ultimate fulfillment.  <br><br>

Life Path Number 1s are usually blessed with
motivation, enthusiasm, creativity and inspiration, and they tend to
be physically healthier and mentally stronger than many other people.
<br><br>
But their strong desire for success could come at a high cost – the
fighting spirit of some Life Path 1s could end up alienating them from
others, or alternatively see their self-esteem plummet. So it is
important for ones to…</p>

The most important thing for the Life Path Number 2 is connecting with
others on a deep, soulful level, so those born into this number tend
to be diplomatic, sensitive individuals who make great judges,
mediators, lawyers counselors or social workers. 
<br><br>
Life Path 2s have the
ability to bring harmony and ease to all group situations. It is very
important for those living out this vibration to get out and
socialize, otherwise they risk feeling isolated and pessimistic, and
suffering from lethargy and depression.

mean that twos may also feel too responsible for…

Life Path Number 3s are the entertainers of the world and most of
these people are truly gifted musicians, writers, actors, dancers,
public speakers and politicians. 
<br><br>
The Life Path 3 is one that is
characterized by beauty, excitement, eccentricity and fame. It’s very
important for those living out this vibration to find authentic ways
to express their inner essence and be truly seen (behind the mask, and

some even escape into…

Life Path Number 4s are often the pillars of their communities. These
individuals are hard working, practical and trustworthy, and as such,
make fantastic marriage and business partners, teachers, mentors and
advisors. 
<br><br>
Their resourceful nature means that they are able to create
something out of nothing and are often called upon in a crisis!
However, self-sacrificing fours often demand too much both of
themselves and others and can develop reputations as martyrs or
tyrants: Their will-power and tenacity being misinterpreted as greed
and stubbornness.

This completely baffles the confused Number 4 whose
intentions are usually to…

spiritually-minded, as well as being great communicators that make
excellent social anthropologists, archaeologists, teachers, writers
and historians.

However, Number 5s can tend towards being
self-absorbed and unaware of the more widespread effects of their
footloose and seemingly reckless actions.

The avoidance of commitment
of many fives can also prevent…

indispensable to others. For this reason, many often dedicate their
lives to being caregivers and service providers such as doctors,
nurses, counselors, firefighters and law keepers. 
<br><br>
The Number 6 is
usually characterized by family, home, space-holding and witness. It’s
very important for these people to find ways to care for and nourish
themselves, as they can easily give so much to others that they end up
energetically depleted. 
<br><br>
For many, this is the real challenge. In fact,
the obligation that many sixes feel is such that they may find
themselves enslaved to…

doctors.

quest to know how it works, and what it all means. The love of
learning held by sevens requires a great deal of private time to

challenge and (necessary) hardships to ecstatic growth and
discoveries.

These avant-garde and visionary individuals make great
students, psychics, mystics, healers, teachers, writers, musicians and
artists. 
<br><br>
Many of those living Master Numbers are “wounded healers” who
at some point in their life suffer a devastating experience that
propels them onto a spiritual path. This is often the beginning of
their quest to discover…
