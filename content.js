const ExpressionnumberName = {
  num1: `<p>Like in most other areas, an Expression Number of 1 signifies strong leadership capabilities, ambition and self-reliance. You are far more prone to take your own advice than that of others. Too many voices whispering in your ear can be difficult and frustrating for you to deal with. You have an entrepreneurial and independent spirit. You are likely to be a big risk-taker and have a magnetic personality. Many military leaders, captains of industry, millionaires, dynamic religious leaders and artists are very often born under the Expression Number of 1.
      <br><br>
    Being a 1 can also make you hyper-critical. This can make you seem judgmental of others which can put strain on your relationships. Learn how to step back, examine your successes but also acknowledge your shortcomings. Learning how to approach those things you tend to most heavily criticize with a small degree of humility will help you tremendously in maintaining harmony and balance. Remember that pride comes before a fall. Be proud of your accomplishments but beware of your inherent narcissistic tendencies.</p>`,
  num2: `<p>You are a big believer in teamwork. You relate well to others and enjoy working with people. You are tactful and a stickler for manners. You also tend to bring out the best in other people and have a talent for circumventing their flaws to accentuate the good in them. You are sensitive and possibly even empathic (that means you you have a mild psychic ability that causes you to feel other people's emotions as if they were your own). You are a natural master of diplomacy and often find yourself acting as a mediator in the midst of conflict.
  <br><br>
    Your adherence to good taste and your desire for harmony can cause you to bruise easily when people are unkind to you. Workplace drama makes you particularly uncomfortable. In the midst of conflict, you are the one that everybody confides in. Be careful not to carry too much of other people's baggage. Twos have a tendency to be selfless to a fault, even letting their own health suffer in their efforts to care for others. Remember that if you believe they need you they also need you around, so step back and think about yourself once in a while.</p>`,
  num3: `<p>You have a way with words. Your communication skills will really take you places. If you have any unexplored talent for writing, acting or public speaking, these are things you should definitely explore. If you don't these things will find their way out of you on their own. All that creativity simply will not stay contained forever. Three is the number for self expression. In nearly every manifestation of 3, the bearer of that number has some semblance of need for attention, but not of any negative kind. Your talents will get attention along with all the positive things about your personality. You see things in ways that other people don't. You think more in images than in words. Your brain is like a mosaic and that is why you have such a tendency to want to broadcast yourself. Your thoughts are vivid and grandiose.
<br> <br>
    The down side to all of this is that you may find yourself going off on lots of tangents and it will be difficult to focus or concentrate on one thing for very long. This is something you will need to work on when it comes to relationships and vocation as later in life this sort of unsettling nature of yours could lead to periods of restlessness and self-doubt. These things can exacerbate your already innate tendencies to be moody or even jaded and cynical. Nip those things in the bud that can draw out the negative parts of your personality.</p>`,
  num4: `<p>When it comes to stability, no one knows how to achieve it like a 4. You have a talent for managing people and projects. You are organized and deliberate in all your actions. You thrive when things have structure and you have a genuine distaste for anything that threatens your stability or that shakes things at their foundations. You have a tendency to reject anything that you consider to be unconventional. “A place for everything and everything in its place” is a motto you are likely to champion. You are careful and cautious. You take few risks and you despise barriers. Before you let these barriers start drawing your focus away from the things that ARE within your reach, you need to recognize them for what they are. They are forces that are designed to test you and challenge you. They want to be broken through, not worked around.
<br><br>
    You are faithful and loyal in your relationships and the feelings you do express are sincere. You are good with children and admire the simplicity of their world, recollecting what it was like before life heaped so much responsibility on your shoulders.
    <br><br>
    You are also good with money. You don't over-spend or live beyond your means. You know your limits and you don't take any more risks with money than you do with anything else in your life. Be careful to not become miserly or else your fixation on maintaining what you have could stand in the way of growing a much more sizable nest egg.</p>`,
  num5: `<p>Adventure and excitement are your main pursuits. You are determined to suck the very marrow out of life. You value your freedom and don't like being tied down. You have many talents, some of which may go untapped for a while but your adaptability to various environments could be the spark that ignites many creative flames within you. Travels to exotic places, interacting with people of different cultures and other experiences in your life will all create a sort of patchwork quilt that you will want to display for the world to see and admire.
    <br><br>
    You like anything that stimulates the senses. You are likely a lover of food and wine but be careful not to get ensnared by things like drug or sexual addiction. Fives tend to like sex in particular and need to figure out a way to get what they need while remaining sensitive to the needs of others. They also quite often need to be protected from self-harm. Know these things and how they relate to you. Your desire to experience things could have consequences you fail to consider when in the moment.</p>`,
  num6: `<p>Sixes and twos are quite a bit alike in terms of their tendencies to place others way ahead of themselves. Sixes, however, find it easier to take sides and assert their own positions. They will side with anyone they believe to be the victims of injustice, prejudice or circumstance. As a 6, your idealistic nature does work very much in your favor when applied to matters of productivity. You know how to get things done and you have no problem feeling proud of yourself. You may have unexplored talents and some of them may never fully manifest. That is not to say that you should not pursue any talent or ability you have – you should! You may simply decide that there are other areas of life that take precedent and that is fine as well.
    <br><br>
    As you get older, you may find yourself gathering things around you that make you feel good. You need to be careful not to overspend on luxuries as you will develop a tendency to cling to things more than people. In the long run, people matter more so work on maintaining your focus.</p>`,
  num7: `<p>You are very analytical and seek to find answers to many complex questions. You are very visual and require proof before you will adopt an idea. This is particularly true in matters of spirituality or belief in a higher power. You seek the truth, not someone else's opinion. You are not closed off to the idea that there are things in this Universe bigger than you, but you need to find them for yourself without anyone else leading you down a particular path.
    <br><br>
    If you haven't discovered the answers to some of life's questions by the time you reach middle age, you could grow to be withdrawn, even to the point of alienation from those who love you. Be open enough to abstract ideas to be able to give and accept love. Many spiritual pursuits are rooted on your ability to do just that and will manifest when you figure out how. Guard your relationships and apply your pragmatic thinking to any decisions concerning extramarital affairs. Sevens have a tendency to wander but they definitely have control over how far.</p>`,
  num8: `<p>You are brimming over with raw potential. To say that you have a strong competitive spirit would be an understatement. You want to be #1 and you are willing to fight for it. You are ver self-disciplined and have no problem giving orders. Taking them, on the other hand, could be a little dicey. If you don't see the personal benefit to it, chances are you are going to be difficult to control. That's all right, though, because the chances of you working for someone else are slim. You won't have to worry about the boss because YOU are the boss. When it comes to money, you just get it. You know its value and you know how to get it. You also know what to do with it when you have it. You are good with investing and growing what you accumulate.
    <br><br>
    Your life will likely be riddled with challenges and you will eventually grow weary of them. The good news is that you will never lose that competitive spirit. The bad news is that you may find these challenges a bit dulling to your competitive edge. Stay sharp, stay focused and remember that you are NOT the type of person that leaves things unfinished. In your estimation, life is a competition. Play the game well until the very end.</p>`,
  num9: `<p>Philanthropic and humanitarian are words that describe you well. You are a champion of any cause that resonates with you. You have a very idyllic way of seeing your role in life and how the world should respond to you. Belief is a powerful thing. You believe that you can move mountains and chances are you will be able to do just that (figuratively speaking, of course). You can visualize sweeping change in this world and you can visualize yourself as instrumental in bringing it about. Your magnetism and ability to influence others will go a long way in getting you there.
    <br><br>
    You don't cling to prejudices either toward people or groups of people. You have a sense of your connectedness to everything around you so you see yourself in everyone and everything. You understand that how you treat others impacts how you feel about yourself. You want to be well so you treat people well. This is why you are successful and why people tend to look up to you.</p>`,
};
const HeartDesireNumberContent = {
  num1: `<p>You have an insatiable need for independence. You are determined to be the master of your own destiny. You are determined to live life on your terms. You not only have leadership qualities, but in many situations consider yourself to be the only qualified leader. This instills you with confidence and helps you make difficult decisions that others would be apprehensive about making
  <br><br>
  Your intelligence is above average and people regard you as being insightful and even inspiring. The leader in you draws out the follower in others. People look to you for your unique perspectives and actually appreciate the controversial nature of some of them. When you believe in something, you commit to it and your enthusiasm is infectious.
  <br><br>
  The negative in all this is that the things you know about yourself and your abilities can make you come across as arrogant or domineering. Be sure to gather around you people who want to be led. Competition can bring out parts of your personality best left out of public view.</p>`,
  num2: `<p>You want all the facets of your life to revolve around peace, harmony and balance. You are a person of unwavering devotion. This applies to all areas of your life as well, and to all your relationships. Your perpetually heightened emotional state can make you extremely sensitive. You may have extreme emotional reactions to art, music, movies, stories, etc.
<br><br>
  Your sensitive nature also leaves you with a very developed intuition. The only problem is that you don't trust it. This is one obstacle that you will learn to overcome but it can take quite a bit of time. You grapple with other areas of self-doubt as well. You have a tendency to undervalue yourself and your role in any given situation. Through all this, you are a source of strength to the right people. Your ability to lend support where it is needed draws them to you.</p>`,
  num3: `<p>You are the life of the party – happy, outgoing, and very personable. People find you inspiring and entertaining and your self-expression skills show themselves in your words. Some people hang on your words but you need to be careful not to over-use your words. You have the tendency to run off at the mouth quite a bit when you are nervous or experiencing an abundance of ego. Those words of yours would be best served in avenues like writing, acting and public speaking.
<br><br>
  You are extremely creative so find an appropriate outlet for your creativity. Those abilities will need to be reined in if you are going to make best use of them. Without focus, you have a tendency to become disorganized and that could leave some of your talents severely under-utilized.</p>`,
  num4: `<p>You have a need for stability and structure in your life. You want your life and everything that touches it to be orderly. You have a systematic way of doing virtually everything. You are often not satisfied unless you are working toward some kind of goal. This makes you focus too heavily on work at times so remember that stability also means having time for yourself. “All work and no play” is not a recipe for structure or stability.
<br><br>
  You are a very loving person but you struggle with your ability to express love outwardly. Don't assume the ones you love know that you love them. They need to be told and you need the practice of telling them. This will help you to achieve the emotional balance that you desire.</p>`,
  num5: `<p>Freedom is an essential element for your happiness to be complete. You love traveling, seeing new places, meeting new people, trying new things. Whenever a new idea comes to you, it gets you excited and your enthusiasm is infectious. This is a valuable leadership ability and one that you must work to continually cultivate and develop.
<br><br>
  Be careful in your pursuit of change and be mindful of where your desire for freedom leads you. This part of your nature can make you extremely impetuous. This is especially true when it comes to finishing things you start. The goal can become an obsession that keeps you from seeing how to best to achieve it and that will tend to frustrate you. Frustration can only hold you back and that sense of disappointment can make you become very reserved emotionally. Don't be afraid to release the passion that wells up within you. Fives are very passionate, they just have trouble finding appropriate outlets for their passion. When you find them, you will be unstoppable.</p>`,
  num6: `<p>There is nothing in your life that is more important than the people you love and your life is about taking care of them. You obsess over meeting their needs even unto the neglect of your own. Fortunately, you find far greater pleasure in giving than receiving. You often find yourself making sacrifices so that others don't have to. You do not, however, have trouble with your sense of self. Although your benevolence and desire to see others around you happy are huge motivators, you also have a need to be recognized for all the good you do. You desire to be appreciated. You want to be loved in return.
<br><br>
  People often seek you out for counsel, but you worry whether or not the advice you give is sound. The solution is to never stop listening, learning or observing. It will be through observing others that you will learn the most about yourself. Sixes are the most apt to maintain fidelity in relationships and understand better the concept of unconditional love than any other number.</p>`,
  num7: `<p>You love learning and gaining knowledge in every area possible. You have a remarkable mind and an ability to understand things on a level that is far deeper than average. You are extremely analytical and you know how to find the information you need to deepen your understanding of things. You aren't much for baseless belief. You have trouble believing in anything that isn't observable or tangible. This makes it difficult for you to extend trust. You can be very rigid and impersonal with people which can be damaging in relationships. Sevens have a hard time letting their feelings show. Feelings are impractical, after all.
<br><br>
  All of these things have a tendency to make you somewhat withdrawn. Your task will be to consciously strive to form meaningful relationships with people, even if it comes down to only a few or even one. You must teach yourself to be vulnerable in a way that allows you to maintain your sense of self as well as your independent spirit. This will not be easy but learning how to do it will have immeasurable benefits.</p>`,
  num8: `<p>Your desire is to achieve what you have built up in your mind to be the pinnacle of success. You hunger – even lust – for things like power, wealth and material possessions. The only problem is that in your pursuit of these things you have a tendency to lack attention to pertinent details. You will find yourself on a constant learning curve as you attempt to harness the aspects and characteristics present in all your core numbers.
<br><br>
  There is no single part of you that will achieve the success you desire. Every facet of your personality and intellect will need to be employed if you are to achieve your goals. Many of your abilities will be sharpened and refined along the way. You will find that this personal evolution makes you an ever-increasingly good judge of other people's character and this trait is one that you must constantly strive to improve and develop.</p>`,
  num9: `<p>Your greatest desire is to champion humanitarian causes and serve others. You are the quintessential perfectionist and you have a truly utopian vision for how life could be. In these idealistic pursuits, your desire for other people's approval will prove to be every bit as important to you as your need to serve. You need to believe completely in whatever you do and have the ability to visualize in your mind the good your efforts can accomplish. Believe and you will achieve.
<br><br>
  As a nine, artistic and creative outlets will be vital to your ability to achieve your goals. They will give you a strong sense of accomplishment and satisfaction which will motivate you in all your endeavors. Your emotional nature will also tend to make you moody. You will find yourself clinging to people at times and wanting to withdraw and be left alone at others. Your biggest challenge will be in learning how to balance meeting the needs of the masses with your own personal responsibilities, particularly to family. Your satisfaction comes in serving others and making sacrifices for them. Be sure that this begins close to home with the ones you love and care for most.</p>`,
};

const PersonalityNumberContent = {
  num1: `<p>You like to blaze your own trails; you know that you are the master of your own destiny. You have a dynamic and energetic personality. You have a particular magnetism but are also very level-headed and controlled. You face problems head-on and deal with conflicts well. When you're wrong or let people see any degree of weakness, you don't like it but you DO maintain a dignified demeanor. You learn well from your mistakes and strive to help others do the same. You are likely more comfortable in a business suit than a bathing suit but with your straight-laced style comes a flair for color. You don't mind being noticed. You have great fashion sense but also manage to maintain your own individual style.

  <br><br>
  You do your best to keep your appearance at a certain level. You fear not being liked or respected if you become overweight. If you are overweight already, chances are you anticipate others being hyper-critical of you which can chip away at yours self-esteem. Do not let your perceived imperfections taint your self-image. If you are capable of changing the things you dislike about yourself, do it. If not, you need to learn to accept it.</p>`,
  num2: `<p>Your genial and friendly demeanor is your most desirable trait. People perceive you as warm, personable and easy to approach. You keep yourself well-groomed and nicely-dressed. You like to look good but also be comfortable. Like your personality, you prefer fabric that is soft and unbinding. You are very passionate and are a very giving lover. You maintain your positive outlook by being committed to your health and well-being and by giving your all to the work you do.

  <br><br>
  You have patience to spare and are not easily rattled. You are slow to anger and quick to forgive. You do your best to never keep a record of wrongs. You bounce back when others hurt you and seek more to understand than to judge. You dislike conflict and find arguments and fights to be draining. You might have grown up with hyper-critical parents who taught you a good deal about how not to view and interact with others and you have put these accidental lessons to work very efficiently. You have an undercurrent of vulnerability in your emotions and personality which makes people trust you.</p>`,
  num3: `<p>YMost people with a Personality Number of 3 are exceptionally attractive. When it occurs in the Outer Personality Number it generally denotes physical beauty. In the minor number it denotes inner beauty and confidence in one's appearance.

  <br><br>
  You exude charm and effervescence. People say that you are full of life. You are likely also a hopeless romantic. You fall in love easily but you fall out just as easily. This trait can wreak havoc with your own emotions and those of the object(s) of your affections so work on keeping those feelings in check. Settling down and maintaining a meaningful romantic relationship will not be easy for you but learning how to operate within these confines will do you a world of good in the emotions category.
  
  <br><br>
  Finally, when opportunity knocks, open the door. Good luck, success and prosperity seem to gravitate to you so don't hinder them!</p>`,
  num4: `<p>People consider you to be reliable and trustworthy. They trust your judgment and seek you out when they need counsel. You represent stability to people and, in your professional pursuits, you are the one that your team looks up to as the example of success and the source of good ideas and strategies. You go out of your way to maintain these ideals and champion respectability as the most important of your personal traits. You are a very precise person and exude an attitude and demeanor that tell people you are in control.

  <br><br>
  You appreciate quality but you balance your desire for good quality with good value, especially in your clothes and possessions. You never overspend just to keep up appearances but will sometimes splurge to reward yourself or keep up your good spirits. In the end, though, you realize the value of money and do your best to spend a little and save a lot when it comes to disposable income. If you are going to splurge on anything, make it something good! A colorful silk tie or a new piece of jewelry will enhance your self-worth as well as your overall persona.</p>`,
  num5: `<p>People find you particularly stimulating. At parties and gatherings, you make an entrance whether you mean to or not. People are always glad to see you and appreciate your sense of humor. You have a laid-back and relaxed demeanor that makes people relax when they're around you. Your sense of optimism and positivity are infectious. They make people want to be around you and emulate your actions and attitudes. People find you to be inspirational.

  <br><br>
  If there is any reason for you to be cautious it is in your tendency to be a bit self-indulgent. That encompasses anything that stimulates you either emotionally or physically, but especially the latter. You have a tendency to want to experience every imaginable vice encompassing food, drink drugs and sex. I high degree of self-discipline will need to be cultivated to avoid unwitting self-destruction.
  
  <br><br>
  You are a natural charmer which could also make you vulnerable to your own carnal urges. It is easy for you to attract as many lovers as you can handle but be wary of spreading your emotions and affections around. Your reputation could suffer for your insistence on self-gratification and indulgence. Again, a bit of self-control will go a long way.</p>`,
  num6: `<p>You have a gift of true compassion so you likewise attract people who are in need of comfort or an empathetic shoulder. You care about their issues and suffer with them whenever they hurt or suffer injustice. Many Personality sixes are also empaths (those who literally sense the emotions of others, especially in areas of sadness, worry, fear or grief). For this reason it is imperative that you guard your own feelings and emotions.

  <br><br>
  You will also need to keep your mind in the game when dealing with people. You are very generous and word of your benevolent ways can spread like wildfire in the wrong circles. There are those who will seek to take advantage of you, especially for money. Be on guard whenever people share their financial woes. The likelihood of getting solicited to lend cash is likely high.
  
  <br><br>
  You are a hopeless romantic but also very loyal. You are always looking to settle down if you haven't already. If you are married, chances are you are the greatest stabilizing force in your relationship. You are faithful and protected. When it comes to your children you are the quintessential mama/papa bear but you also respect your children's need for space. You love with all your being but do your best not to smother.
  
  <br><br>
  You have a singular appreciation for the arts. You are a music lover over a broad spectrum and you enjoy live concerts and theater. You take pride in your tastes in these things and love sharing them with others.</p>`,
  num7: `<p>People view you as mysterious. This is not necessarily a bad thing; it all depends on how you approach it. Let people see your sense of independence and self-sufficiency. Don't be afraid to show your intelligence but be sure to cultivate points of commonality with others. This will lend intrigue to your sense of mystery as opposed to dread. You may never gain a reputation for being warm or compassionate but people just can't help respecting you.

  <br><br>
  You have particular spiritual beliefs and are very serious about them. You bring many unique insights to the table when discussing spirituality or theology and your perspective on things causes people to think about their own beliefs.
  
  <br><br>
  The downside to all of this is that, while many people will likely respect you, they will also find you hard to approach. They will subsequently not make many strides to get to know you, opting instead to be content knowing about you. Be careful not to cultivate the appearance of arrogance or self-absorption. This is an easy trap into which Personality sevens can fall.</p>`,
  num8: `<p>Your sense of inner strength is considerable but beware how that is perceived by others. You may not even know just how much influence your actions and personality can have but you hold within your grasp the ability to either build up or tear down with your words and actions. This is true in all your dealings with people from simple business transactions to serious relationships with a significant other, spouse, children or extended family. You have a tendency to be generous but you also have the tendency to size up a person's situation, attitude and trustworthiness before deciding to help them.

  <br><br>
  Be mindful of your appearance. Dress to impress. The right wardrobe can have a distinct balancing effect on your ability to command various situations and parts of your life. Work on being more approachable and learn to accept other people's tendency to defer the difficult stuff to you. They do it because they know you can handle things that they cannot. Your sense of confidence can detract from that of others so be careful not to inadvertently chip away at other people's self-esteem. Commit to working within your own boundaries and recognize that yours are likely broader than those of the next person. Recognize also that this is okay and know when to step back and give others the opportunity to stretch and grow. You'll be more comfortable around them if they are allowed to do that in front of you.</p>`,
  num9: `<p>You have a tendency to stand upright and proud. You are confident in your talents and abilities. Many actors, musicians and other kinds of artists tend to have a 9 personality. You win people's admiration through the proliferation and exercise of your talents. The downside is that your talent can stir jealousy and envy in other people. They will tend not to like you based solely on their own insecurities. Be warned: jealousy almost always leads to vindictiveness and bitterness. Give no one reason to want you as their enemy.

  <br><br>
  There really is no way around it: you are going to be perceived as a little bit arrogant. Your ability to turn this off is practically non-existent so rather than stifle it, you will have to go out of your way to justify it by constantly one-upping and re-inventing yourself. At the same time you will also need to cultivate enough of an attitude of humility to keep yourself grounded. Don't start believing your own press. Look for areas in need of improvement and set goals to make those improvements. This shouldn't be too difficult considering that you are also a giver at heart. You like to let others experience some of the fruits of your accomplishments and acts of compassion help build your self-esteem.</p>`,

  num1: `<p>You have unlimited potential, yet you lack motivation. You need to take more initiative, be more proactive. You need to work on your level of determination when it comes to every aspect of life: work, relationships, anything that is important to you but takes effort to achieve or obtain. Sooner or later, you will find yourself being forced out of your comfort zone; you will be faced with many hard choices and will have to make decisions absent of anyone else's counsel.
<br><br>
  You life path will often intersect with people who are difficult and strong-willed. When that happens, you will either learn to assert your position or become their doormat. These things will sharpen you. They will bring out the dynamic parts of your personality and give you a greater sense of self. Try not to place too much value on what other people think of you. Your job is to cultivate a better self-image. Believe in yourself. Trust your intuition. Try not to be a procrastinator.</p>`,
  num2: `<p>Diplomacy and tact are not your strong suits. You will need to work on this. Be willing to be a behind-the-scenes contributor. Learn to set goals and reach them for the sake of the accomplishment more than the accolade. You don't need to be in the spotlight all the time. Work on your ability to be a team player.
<br><br>
  You need to start being more observant of other people's feelings. You have a tendency to plough over people. Learn to stand back and let them stretch and grow. Your successes in life will all come at the cost of you learning a thing or two about delayed gratification, patience and cooperation. You will find yourself forced to share credit on many projects, even when you are a major or nearly sole contributor.</p>`,
  num3: `<p>You are your own worst critic. You find the spotlight to be embarrassing, mostly because you have already convinced yourself that everything you have to offer is somehow fundamentally flawed. You adhere to a goal of perfectionism that is unreachable and yet you weigh all your actions, intentions, talents, abilities and self-worth against it. In short, you need to relax. Keep on like this and you will never get any joy out of life.
<br><br>
  Learn how to laugh. More importantly, learn how to laugh AT YOURSELF. It is wonderful therapy. Life is going to place you in the position of having to think creatively and come up with out-of-the-box solutions to various problems. The trick is going to be in getting yourself to trust your own instincts and intuitions; you are going to need to get out of your own way or this failure complex of yours is going to escalate into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Threes are often very artistic. If your Karmic Lesson is 3, however, success will be a long and difficult road. You will get there, but it will be a steady, steep uphill climb.</p>`,
  num4: `<p>You feel your life is lacking direction. You don't think you are ever going to know what you want to be when you grow up, eve though you've likely been an adult for a while. You need to set certain ground rules for your life and stick with them. You need to set your feet on solid ground. Set some real goals or you will never feel that your life has balance.
<br><br>
  Find what makes you happy and just do it. There are ways to make a living doing practically anything. Be willing to start over repeatedly if you have to. Sooner or later you will discover your niche. When you start asking yourself questions like, “What's wrong with me?” or “Why can't I seem to ever___?” you have the tendency to look for external answers. The problem, though, is that these things originate within YOU so that is where you will need to look to find the answers. Yes, this is very uncomfortable but so is never actualizing your potential.</p>`,
  num5: `<p>You lack any real sense of adventure. There is a huge world out there waiting for you to experience all it has to offer but you are literally afraid of living. Take advantage of every opportunity to experience things in life. Travel whenever you can. Get off the beaten path and see this world from a different perspective than others. The things you experience will make you more aware of yourself and will help you develop a zest for life.
<br><br>
  Change is a difficult concept for you. You don't like it. You will therefore be forced to make changes and adapt to them. This will necessitate you being more flexible. You tend to be very rigid and not give new experiences a chance. Learn what you can about the concept of faith. Remember, there are very few absolutes in life. You need to believe in something. Start with yourself; it is the logical first step.</p>`,
  num6: `<p>You have issues committing to anything. This is true of relationships but also work projects or maybe even a career. You come across as uncaring or emotionless. You need to let people see your range of emotions and be more demonstrative. You might often feel alone even if you have people around you who care about you and whom you love as well. You need to learn how to be sincere and communicate your feelings more effectively. Life will throw many opportunities to learn this lesson at you. Don't dodge them, face them.
<br><br>
  You will learn how important it is to have friends and confidants and how fulfilling a lasting, committed relationship can be. You will learn the concepts of giving and self-sacrifice. There are few things that are more difficult to learn but also few that are of greater value.</p>`,
  num7: `<p>You tend to take an overly casual approach to certain things. You will find yourself forced to increase knowledge and skill in at least one specific area in your life, or perhaps even one at a time. Life may cause you to live in the same cycles until you finally “get” your lesson. You could definitely use a slightly more self-critical attitude. Sometimes you literally think you could do no wrong but the reality is that we all have flaws and defects. Learning to work through them is far more beneficial than constantly working around them.
<br><br>
  There is more to the things that occupy your life than what you see on the surface. Learn to dig deeper, expect more and understand better</p>`,
  num8: `<p>Your financial life is going to have some major highs and lows. You are good at attracting prosperity. You may even have a good head for business. These things will not, however, shield you from having money problems. This is mostly owning to your inability to be cautious enough with your money. Even more, you don't like being given advice. You don't want people telling you how things should be done. You have a real “my way or the highway” attitude and that can keep you from taking full advantage of opportunities when they come knocking. This is especially true if opportunity comes at the expense of being someone else's subordinate. You don't like having a boss. The problem is that your dislike for authority also prevents you from recognizing or setting reasonable boundaries. You have trouble seeing your own limitations and that makes you come across as a know-it-all.
<br><br>
  You will find yourself in situations where hard lessons are learned by being so thick-skinned. You will be forced to admit that you need help, especially when it comes to managing money. Help will present itself and you will have to force yourself to accept it if you want to maintain your standard of living. Making money will likely never be a problem for you but knowing what to do with it will.</p>`,
  num9: `<p>You have a severe lack of empathy or compassion. Even in your own head, your thoughts often strike you as being callous or uncaring. You need to learn to give people the opportunity to fail in front of you. This is how all of us learn and grow. Develop a sense of tolerance for other people's limitations
<br><br>
  Life will force you to become less egocentric and closed-minded. It will teach you how to see the Big Picture and how each and every person and thing around you has value. You will learn that other people's opinions matter. You will discover what it is to relate to other people's pain. You will learn the importance of showing kindness and compassion. You will learn that there is fulfillment in helping other people, even in seemingly small ways.
  <br><br>
  You will find yourself struggling to function within the community until you recognize that you are part of it and it is part of you. Take the initiative to simply talk to people. Get to know them on a more meaningful level. Don't be afraid to lend an ear to someone's story now and then. Odds are you will learn a great deal about yourself from those experiences.</p>`,
