      <span>"What does the day you were born mean?</span>
      <p>
        What is the difference between the Life Path Number and the Birth Day
        Number?
        <br />
        As these two things are so closely related, it makes perfect sense to
        wonder what, if any, difference there may be between the two. Simply
        put, your birth day number, while still almost always reduced to a
        single digit (with the exceptions of 11 and 22) is often the sum of two
        digits. It does not take into account the month or year like the Life
        Path Number. Someone with a birth day number of 6, for example, could
        have been born on the 6th, 15th, or 24th of the month and each digit
        that goes into the number used to calculate your birth day number is
        significant. For this reason, we will examine all days from 1 to 31
        broken down by birth day number and specific details regarding the
        actual day.

        <h2>The Period Cycle Numbers</h2>
        <span>Your Period Cycle Transition Points</span>
        <p>
          Every story has several distinct parts: exposition, rising action,
          climax and falling action. This is referred to in literary terms as a
          “dramatic arc.” The first part lays the foundation of the story. The
          second builds to a specific apex where the height of the action or
          tension in the story is at its greatest and almost always culminates
          with a resolution to the conflict, whether positive or negative. The
          last is followed by the tying up of loose ends or the result of the
          climactic event. In some stories the climax occurs relatively far from
          the end, while in others it can occur so close to the end that there
          is little to no falling action to speak of.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter what you may believe about who you are and where your soul
          has been before, the fact remains that the day you were born into this
          life was the beginning of something huge. All the potential that you
          have as a person, everything that you might do with your life exists
          in that moment unabated by circumstance, choice or free will. Think
          about it: every possible scenario exists, both good and bad. The way
          way we interact with the world (or how it interacts with us) starts
          creating variances almost immediately, but at that moment, on that
          day, the potential to Be in this life is at the height of its power.
        </p>

        <p>In many ways, life mimics this model.</p>

        <p>
          Each of our lives is divided into three periods, should we live out a
          normal lifespan of at least six decades or greater. In today's world,
          this is even more common than even within the past few decades. People
          are living longer and the dividing line between life periods can leave
          plenty of room for falling action and wrap-up.
        </p>

        <span>The Significances of the Periods</span>

        <p>
          The first period mimics the expositive and rising parts of the story
          and lasts anywhere from 25 to 34 years. The second marks significant
          turning points - “adult” conflicts and problems that need to be
          resolved and most often carry significant change in their wake. This
          period generally lasts about as long as the first. The third period
          has a settling effect wherein the results of the climactic chapter (or
          chapters) in our lives manifest. The length of this period varies
          depending on the total lifespan of the individual. <br /><br />
          We can also look at it this way: the first period is a time of
          self-discovery that begins with all things being new. We spend years
          learning about ourselves, about the world, it's high points and its
          pitfalls. We lose our childhood innocence and discover some harsh
          realities about the world and what lies ahead. The second cycle is
          where we take everything that we've learned in the first and find
          useful application for it. We approach everything with a healthy dose
          of conventional wisdom and common sense mingled with a glimmer of
          intuition and these things culminate in the actualization of the Self.
          We learn who we are, often become set in our ways and journey onward
          into the final period. This is where our true nature takes root and
          clearly defines the men and women we were meant to become. At this
          point, the hard part is over, now it's just a matter of taking
          responsibility for those things we know about ourselves.
        </p>
        <span>Finding Your Period Cycle Numbers</span>

        <p>
          Your first Period Cycle Number is found by reducing your month of
          birth to a single digit or master number, so if your birth month is
          November, your first period number is 11. If it's October, your number
          is 1, etc. <br />
          Your second Period Cycle Number is calculated using your day of birth,
          reduced to one digit or a master number. If you were born on the 29th,
          your number is 11. If you were born on the 16th, your number is 7, and
          so on.
          <br /><br />
          Your third Period Cycle Number is calculated using the four-digit year
          of your birth, again reduced to a single digit or master number. 2009
          would be 11 (2+0+0+9 = 11), 1993 would be 22 (1+9+9+3 = 22), 1980
          would be 9 (1+9+8+0 = 18; 1+8 = 9), and so on.

        <span>Why Your Name Matters</span>
        <p>
          People often wonder how past lives weigh in with Numerology and the
          answer is simply that they don't. In my belief system, the soul takes
          many journeys and chronicles its experiences as it keeps reappearing
          over and over in different places, maybe even on different planets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you believe in things like reincarnation or not is up to you
          but don't get hung up on the idea that you have to know about your
          past life to understand this one. Numerology deals with the here and
          now. Whatever you believe about your past lives (or lack thereof) has
          no bearing on the way you read your numbers for THIS lifetime. If this
          isn't your soul's first trip through the cosmos, your numbers in a
          past life would be radically different than in this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Universe is nothing more than a huge expression of energy. There
          is nothing truly solid. If there was, physics tells us that it would
          have the capability of destroying the planet with its absolute
          adherence to gravity. So as we are part of the Universe, so we are
          also expressions of energy. The moment of our birth is significant. We
          receive our names from our parents whose energy also flows through us
          and things start to take shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the first things that life confers upon is a name. The name we
          receive is a reflection of everything we are, everything we will do,
          everything that makes us “us” in the first place. These things exist
          in a place that transcends time and space and our names tell us things
          about ourselves that know no temporal boundaries. Yes, we have free
          will, therefore our futures are not set. Our numbers, however, can
          help us tremendously in terms of how we exercise our free will and
          they can assist us in making good choices. The first number we are
          going to examine in reference to our name is the Expression Number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Expression Number says quite a bit about your abilities and
          talents along with your imperfections and shortcomings. All of these
          were present at the time of your birth and your name reflects them. It
          is NOT an accident that you have the name that you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Expression number reveals the talents, abilities, and shortcomings
          that were with you when you entered your human body. Your name, and
          the numbers derived from it, reveal your development, as well as the
          talents and issues you will be working with during this life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding Your Expression Number <br /><br />
          Every letter in your name has a numeric value. Some will say that you
          need only calculate your first name but I say that's a fallacy. Your
          surname (“last” name) speaks much more of your individual history and,
          when computed along with your first name, can provide a much clearer
          picture of the expression of energy that currently exists as “you.” If
          you have a middle name, calculate that, too. Leave no stone unturned
          nor any piece of yourself unexamined. Calculate each letter in order.
          Do NOT reduce each part of your name separately. Come up with a single
          sum for the whole thing first.
          <br /><br />
          In order to find your Expression Number, refer to this chart:

      <h2>Heart's Desire Number</h2>
      <span>What Does Your Heart's Desire Number Mean?</span>
      <p>
        The Heart's Desire Number (also known as the The Soul's Urge or, simply,
        The Soul Urge) represents precisely what it implies. It speaks of the
        thing or things you yearn for the most. These are the dreams of your
        heart, the ultimate ideals for which you long and meditate upon. It also
        tells of the thing or things that motivate you and reveals the true
        intentions behind numerous actions. This number has a strong influence
        on everything you do in your life. This includes, but is not limited to,
        your home and work environments, the company you keep, your lifestyle
        choices and your tastes. Your Heart's Desire number tells much about
        your soul's journey in its present incarnation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your heart's desire is calculated using the vowels in your name and, in
        this instance, middle names count. What ever name you were given at
        birth is what you are going to use to find your Heart's Desire Number.
        The vowels in question are A, E, I, O, U, and (sometimes) Y. The
        “sometimes Y” rule is important in this calculation.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Vowels vs. Consonants</strong></p>
      <p>
        Without diverting too far into a lesson in English phonics, vowel sounds
        are those phonetic tones that complete syllables. Where there's a
        syllable, there's a vowel. In words like “my” or “cry” it is easy to
        tell that the Y functions as a vowel. What many people don't know is
        that it is also a vowel in any word where it supplies the vowel sound in
        the syllable. That also makes Y a vowel in words like “marry,” “carry”
        “very” and “sorry.” If your name is something like Karyn, Bryan, Gary or
        Yvonne, you want to count the Y as a vowel. It is not a vowel in words
        like “year,” “yes,” “yawn” or “yank” because there is at least one vowel
        present already and its sound completes a syllable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to determine vowels from consonants is in the resonance of
        the letter. Vowels have a more drawn-out sound to them like “ayyy” or
        “ahhh.” They also mimic each-other in some instances. “Ahhh” for example
        can be represented by an A or an O. “Eee” can be represented by an E or
        an I. Consonants have more defined tones and are more sharp. This is
        true even of consonants like C that have both hard and soft
        pronunciations (“sss” like in “ice” and “kuh” as in “cream”).
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought it important to make that brief diversion since there are some
        people who have never had those concepts explained to them, and also
        because not everyone speaks English as a native language. Since this
        guide assumes use of the English language, understanding the basics is
        essential for doing accurate calculations.
      </p>
      <span>Calculating Your Heart's Desire Number</span>
      <p>
        The main numerology page contains a chart that shows the numerical
        values of each letter in the English alphabet. Since we are only dealing
        with six letters in this chapter, I have listed the numerical values of
        the vowels for you. They are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A = 1</li>
        <li>E = 5</li>
        <li>I = 9</li>
        <li>O = 6</li>

        <span>What Does Your Personlaity Number Mean?</span>
        <p>
          For numerological purposes, the Personality and Minor Personality
          Numbers share the same interpretations, but the two are rarely one and
          the same. The two are often referred to as the Outer Personality
          Number and the Minor Personality Number. The two differ in the letters
          that are used to calculate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Heart's Desire Numbers deal with vowels, the Personality
          Numbers deal with consonants. The calculations are similar in that the
          Outer Personality Number is calculated using the consonants in your
          given name – the name you were given at birth, like the Heart's Desire
          Number. Your Minor Personality Number uses the consonants in your
          nickname, the name you use to introduce yourself in casual situations,
          just like the Minor Heart's Desire Number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Outer Personality number speaks to the qualities and attributes
          you possess that you are comfortable sharing with others. This is the
          public You. Your Minor Personality Number speaks of those things you
          keep to yourself or only share with those you love and trust. This is
          the private You
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Personality Numbers also speak of how others perceive you. The
          things you keep hidden may be more visible than you think they are so
          pay close attention to the Minor number and see if the private you
          might be sneaking into public view.

        <h2>Karmic Lesson Numbers</h2>
        <span>The Opposing Forces in Your Life</span>
        <p>
          In previous chapters, we have looked at Numerology from the standpoint
          of concrete, determinable and observable areas of one's character.
          Going forward, things become a bit more governed by metaphysics and
          inner mysteries. Instead of calculating to find information based on
          simpler areas like your birth date, we are going to examine areas that
          may or may not be obvious to the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about it this way: have you ever received a gift that you didn't
          know you wanted until you were in possession of it but then realized
          how well it fit into your life? Have you ever tasted food and
          wondered, “Why did I never try this before? It's delicious!” The next
          set of calculations spring from the premise that there are things
          about ourselves that we don't know yet. Some people may be put off by
          the idea of eating sushi but once they try it they can't get enough.
          It stands to reason that they always liked it but never knew it until
          it became something they experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it is with the next set of calculations: they are all about
          discovering things our minds and our souls already know but with which
          our experience has not yet caught up. Now just a word of caution: not
          everything has a pleasurable outcome. There are some things that we
          think we just don't want to know. The problem, however, is that those
          things are still part of us no matter how off-putting they may be.
          Anyone who finds him or herself on a spiritual journey must realize
          that it is neither healthy nor beneficial to run from or hide from the
          darker aspects of our nature. The more we know about them, the more
          complete we become as spiritual beings, so fear not! There is much to
          learn and doing so will make us better individuals in the long run.
        </p>
        <span>The Karmic Lessons</span>
        <p>
          We enter into our current incarnation with things that work in our
          favor and those that work against us. We all have strengths but we
          also have weaknesses. It is important not to forsake examining one to
          cultivate the other (or worse, to overshadow the other). Karmic
          Lessons deal primarily with our areas of weakness. The purpose of
          exploring them is finding the way to see them and interact with them
          in a productive manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          As has been previously explained, each letter in our names has its own
          corresponding number. Certain numbers repeat, some appear only once,
          some do not appear at all. Karmic Lessons are determined by the
          numbers that do NOT present in your name. Missing numbers = Karmic
          Lessons. If a number repeats at least once, that number is a Karmic
          Strength or “Hidden Passion.” There is an entire other area to examine
          when dealing with Hidden Passions so, for the time being, we will
          simply focus on the concept of Strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The letters in your name and their corresponding numbers point to the
          various talents and abilities that each of us possesses. Think of
          these letters and numbers as tools in a box. Not every tool will be in
          your box; you are required to work with the ones at your disposal.
          Letters and numbers that are missing represent tools that are not
          available for you to use. They make their way into your box by way of
          experience and can take a lifetime (or longer) to fully master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those people who have three or more numbers missing from their Karmic
          Lesson Chart would do well to heed this advice: your focus needs to be
          on what you CAN do, not what you cannot. The cannots will take care of
          themselves over time. You need to understand also that missing three
          or more numbers almost always denotes at least one period in your life
          where you will only find success or fulfillment through adversity. You
          will have to try harder than average to be happy but, in the end, you
          will have a greater appreciation for things many other people take for
          granted.

          instances where things occur without warning. It shows how sharp an
          ability you have to think on your feet and how well you assess and
          manage a variety of situations.

          Your Subconscious self is directly related to your Karmic Lesson chart
          wherein the possibility exists of having all nine numbers represented
          in your name. Most people will have fewer and some much fewer (the
          number can be as low as three). Remember that the missing numbers are
          the ones that determine your Karmic Lessons and these are the areas in
          which you are likely to feel a certain degree of uncertainty and
          inadequacy.

          The Subconscious Self is determined by adding up the quantity of
          represented numbers in your name. In other words, if the numbers
          1,3,6,7, and 9 are represented, your Subconscious Self number is 5.
          Remember that you are NOT calculating the represented numbers, just
          counting how many of them there are. In the above example, five
          numbers are represented so that is the answer. It is also interesting
          to note that the minimum number that can possibly be represented is
          three. It is impossible to have just two or one so don't go searching
          for the interpretations of 1 and 2. They simply do not exist.

          The more numbers you have represented, the more capable you ultimately
          are to deal with a variety of situations.

        <h2>Balance Number</h2>
        <p>
          Life challenges elicit different responses from different people. Some
          tend to withdraw from situations so they can regroup inside their own
          heads and sort things out. Others bury their own emotions and
          ostensibly hide from their problems. Others still react quickly and
          emotionally but pull themselves together equally fast. Others let
          their emotions simmer for a long time, reliving the details, carrying
          the weight of the situation long after it should have been put down.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we mature, we learn better how to deal with these things and the
          way we deal with them (or how we let them affect us) changes and
          evolves. We become more effective at managing the feelings and
          emotions that extreme situations thrust upon us. Your Balance Number
          provides counsel on how we, as specific individuals, can best handle
          situations that are threatening, difficult or emotionally draining.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Balance number is a minor influence on your chart, but it can be
          afforded undue weight if we start relying too heavily on it to deal
          with our personal lives feeling out of balance. When we experience
          emotional upheaval, regardless of the reason, being familiar with our
          Balance number can make the difference between able to control
          situations and letting them control us.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Balance Number is not part of many Numerology Charts, but it is
          nonetheless useful in moments when a little wise counsel on a
          situation is warranted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your Balance Number says quite a bit about your abilities and talents
          along with your imperfections and shortcomings. All of these were
          present at the time of your birth and your name reflects them. It is
          NOT an accident that you have the name that you do.
